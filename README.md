# Grduation Problem Assignment

## Background

This repository contains programs to calculate conditional probability for a given problem statement.   
This is an interview assignemt for company **IMPACT ANALYTICS**.  
The problem is described below -

### Problem -

		In a university, your attendance determines whether you will be
		allowed to attend your graduation ceremony.
		You are not allowed to miss classes for four or more consecutive days.
		Your graduation ceremony is on the last day of the academic year,
		which is the Nth day.

		 

		  Your task is to determine the following:

		1. The number of ways to attend classes over N days.
		2. The probability that you will miss your graduation ceremony.

		Represent the solution in the string format as "Answer of (2) / Answer
		of (1)", don't actually divide or reduce the fraction to decimal

		Test cases:

		for 5 days: 14/29
		for 10 days: 372/773


## Project Setup  

> Check out the code from the repository to your local machine and go to root dir.  

        $ your_directory_path/cd geo-query-app


> Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Chec it bu running
		
		$ python3 --version (for mac/linux)
		$ python --version (for windows)

> Run main file 

        $ python3 main.py

 
### Input/Output

	- Input format should be an Integer. Incase you want to stop calculaing you can enter -1 to exit the program.

	- Output format will be fraction which conatins the probability.
	  format - 
		(probability that you will miss your graduation ceremony)/(number of ways to attend classes over N days)
